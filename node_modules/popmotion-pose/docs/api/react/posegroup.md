# `PoseGroup`

The `PoseGroup` component manages `enter` and `exit` animations on its direct children as they enter and exit the component tree.

<TOC />

## Import

```javascript
import posed, { PoseGroup } from 'react-pose'
```

## Usage

By adding a [posed component](/api/posed) as a direct child of `PoseGroup`, it will gain two new poses: `enter` and `exit`.

```javascript
const Item = posed.div({
  enter: { opacity: 1 },
  exit: { opacity: 0 }
})

const ItemList = ({ items }) => (
  <PoseGroup>
    {items.map((item) => <Item key={item.id} />)}
  </PoseGroup>
)
```

**Note:** Every child must be provided a unique `key` property for `PoseGroup` to track entering and exiting children.

### Animating children

As with any posed component, the `enter`/`exit` pose will propagate throughout any of its posed component children.

In the case of the `exit` pose, `PoseGroup` will only unmount the animating component once **all of its children** have also finished their `exit` animation.

## Props

### animateOnMount

`animateOnMount: boolean = false`

By default, only children added to the `PoseGroup` **after** it has mounted are animated to `enter`.

By setting `animateOnMount` to `true`, all children elements will animate in on mount.

### enterPose

`enterPose: string = 'enter'`

The name of the pose to use when a component enters.

### exitPose

`exitPose: string = 'exit'`

The name of the pose to use when a component leaves.

### preEnterPose

`preEnterPose: string = 'exit'`

The name of the pose to set before a component enters. This can be used to configure where a components animates in **from**.

### flipMove

`flipMove: boolean = true`

When an element exits, Pose takes it out of the layout and applies `position: absolute` so it can detect the new position of surrounding elements and animate via FLIP.

While it attempts to figure out the correct matching `transform-origin` there are times when this fails. Setting `flipMove={false}` will prevent these issues.
